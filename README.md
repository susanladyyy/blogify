### Blog Platform with Content Importer

---

## **Objective**

Build a simple blog platform that can import content from external APIs.  
Show us your approach to API integration and data transformation.

## **Time Estimate**

This task should not take more than 4 hours.

---

## **Requirements**

### **Blog Features**

- Blog posts with: `title`, `content`, `status` (draft/published), `source`, `external_id`
- Admin panel to manage posts
- Public page to view published posts

### **Import Functionality**

- Import from **JSONPlaceholder API** — random blog post
- Import from **FakeStore API** — random product (transform to blog post)
- Single item import per execution
- Duplicate prevention
- Imported posts saved as drafts

### **APIs**

- **JSONPlaceholder**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{randomId}`
- **FakeStore API**: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/{randomId}`

---

## **The Challenge**

Transform two different data structures into consistent blog posts.

### **JSONPlaceholder Post Example**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "blog post title", 
  "body": "blog post content"
}
```

### **FakeStore Product Example**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product description",
  "price": 109.95,
  "category": "product category"
}
```

Both should be transformed into blog posts in your system.

## **Setup**

```bash
git clone [repository]
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```
